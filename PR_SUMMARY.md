# PR: Migrate Tournament fixed prizes to ordered `amounts` array

Summary
-------

This PR changes the `Tournament.prizes.fixed` shape from legacy object keys (`1st`, `2nd`, `3rd`, `4th`, `5th`) to an ordered `amounts` array (index 0 => 1st, index 1 => 2nd, ...). It also removes the hard-coded limit of 5 fixed prizes across the codebase and adds a migration script and compatibility hooks so the change can be rolled out safely.

Why
---

- The legacy `'1st'..'5th'` object shape is error-prone and awkward to work with in aggregation and programmatic logic.
- Using an ordered array (`amounts`) is simpler, supports an arbitrary number of fixed prizes, and avoids repeated code.
- Compatibility hooks and a migration script allow a safe, staged rollout.

What changed
------------

- `models/Tournament.js`
  - Added `prizes.fixed.amounts: [Number]` and `prizes.fixed.additional` array.
  - Added `post('init')` hook to populate `fixed.amounts` from legacy keys at runtime for backward compatibility.
  - Added `pre('save')` normalization to persist `amounts` when saving legacy-shaped documents.

- `controllers/tournamentController.js`
  - Creation/normalization flow now accepts both the new `fixed.amounts` array and legacy `fixed['1st']..` keys; when legacy keys are present it builds `amounts` from the provided keys (no padding to 5).
  - Prize pool calculation and distribution logic now sum the entire `fixed.amounts` array (no 5-limit).

- `controllers/adminDashboard.js`
  - Aggregation pipeline and expected-prize construction updated to use the entire `prizes.fixed.amounts` array (removed `$slice` and `slice(0,5)` limits).

- `scripts/migrateFixedPrizes.js` (new)
  - Migration script to convert existing tournaments using legacy keys into `prizes.fixed.amounts` and unset legacy keys.

- `package.json`
  - Added npm script: `migrate-fixed-prizes` to run the migration script.

- `docs/TOURNAMENT_SCHEMA_MIGRATION.md` (new)
  - Steps and guidance for running the migration safely (backup, staging, verification).

Files changed (primary)
----------------------

- models/Tournament.js
- controllers/tournamentController.js
- controllers/adminDashboard.js
- scripts/migrateFixedPrizes.js (added)
- package.json (scripts)
- docs/TOURNAMENT_SCHEMA_MIGRATION.md (added)
- PR_SUMMARY.md (this file)

Backward compatibility and rollout plan
-------------------------------------

1. Deploy this code with the compatibility model hooks in place. The app will accept both shapes and will present `fixed.amounts` for legacy documents in-memory.
2. Run the migration script against a staging DB (backup first), then verify documents now have `prizes.fixed.amounts` and legacy `1st`..`5th` keys are removed.
3. After smoke tests in staging, run the migration against production (after a DB backup).
4. Once all production documents are migrated and you're confident, the legacy compatibility fields in the model can be removed in a follow-up cleanup PR.

Migration command
-----------------

Set your MongoDB connection and run the migration script (PowerShell example):

```powershell
$env:MONGODB_URL = 'mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@cluster0.example.mongodb.net/<db>'
npm run migrate-fixed-prizes
```

Verification (suggested checks)
-------------------------------

- Spot-check a few tournaments in the DB before/after migration to ensure `prizes.fixed.amounts` exists and legacy keys are removed.
- Use the admin dashboard to view a tournament's prize breakdown and verify totals/payouts look correct.
- Run unit/integration tests (if available) and smoke-test API endpoints that list tournaments and payout data.

Reviewer checklist
------------------

- [ ] Confirm model schema changes are compatible with other code paths.
- [ ] Confirm aggregation/pipeline updates correctly compute total prize pools for variable-length arrays.
- [ ] Confirm migration script is idempotent and safe (backups available).
- [ ] Confirm no remaining runtime code enforces exactly five fixed prizes.
- [ ] Run staging migration and verify UI/admin flows before production migration.

Risks & mitigations
-------------------

- Risk: Some older documents may contain only legacy keys and code that expects `amounts` may fail — mitigated by model compatibility hooks.
- Risk: Mistakes in migration could lose legacy fields — mitigated by unsetting legacy keys only after setting `amounts` and by requiring a DB backup.

Notes
-----

- I ran a repo scan and removed the last hard-coded 5-limit in aggregation and JS code. Remaining references to `'1st'..'5th'` are labels, migration references, and legacy schema declarations necessary for migration/compatibility.

Short PR summary for the GitHub description
------------------------------------------

Title: Migrate Tournament fixed prizes to ordered `amounts` array (drop legacy 1st..5th keys)

Description (short): Replace legacy `prizes.fixed['1st'..'5th']` with an ordered `prizes.fixed.amounts` array, remove the hard 5-prize limit, add compatibility hooks and a migration script. Deploy first (compat hooks included), then run migration against staging/production. See `docs/TOURNAMENT_SCHEMA_MIGRATION.md` for steps.
